## :man_technologist: Brief introduction
Hello, [Witold1](https://witold1.github.io/) is here! You might recognize me from my involvement in various analytical projects, insightful blog comments, and captivating [DataViz products](https://witold1.github.io/). Below, you'll find a selection of [open projects](#-remarkable-projects) that I believe are worth sharing from my previous experiences.

If you're interested in collaborating on projects that require joint expertise or need recommendations regarding data sources and data processing, don't hesitate to reach out.

> Currently, I am excelling in Sales-Strategy-Operations, and Business Intelligence practices at a local automotive company that operates across the Midwestern USA, where I boost sales of niche cars with data-driven strategies as well as contribute to analytical infrastructure. Prior to this role, I held a position in the Business Intelligence and Data Services team at the leading North America automotive FinTech-F&I Platform headquartered in metro Detroit. Prior, I have gained valuable professional experience in the Advanced Analytics and Data Science team of a prominent R&D Intelligence consulting firm in Europe.
